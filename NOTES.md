**Console Program**
- println & print
	- Console -> text entry and display window/screen/device
					On Windows cmd,
    - HelloWorld with println
    - println (print line)
    - println("Some Text");
		- quotes does not appear in output
	- println();
    - print()
- Escape sequences
- escape sequence: A special sequence of characters used to represent certain special characters in a string.
	- **\t** 		tab character
	- **\n 		new line character
	- **\"** 		quotation mark character
	- **\\** 		backslash character

- Variables
	- location to store some kind of value inside RAM
	- has name
	- use the name

- Making new variables
	int myVariable;

- Type of variables
	- **int**, **double**, **boolean**, **char**
	- **String** (technically it’s not the type of variable, it’s ref type)
	- and many others

int vs double
	int used for counting (how many)
	double for measurements (how much)

- variable declaration
	- Sets aside memory for storing a value.
	- Variables must be declared before they can be used.
	- Examples:
        - int myAge;
        - double temperature;
        - String myName
        - In general **type name**; (general format)

- Assignment: Stores a value into a variable.
    - assign value to variable
    - temperature = 27.3;
        - temperature is variable name here
        - temperature variable must have been declared
    - In general, variableName = expression;
        - we'll see what are expressions in a minute
    - def:
        -
